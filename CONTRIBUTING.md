### Submitting Code Changes

If you would like to contribute code:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`).
4. **Make your changes** in the new branch.
5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive commit message.
6. **Push the branch** to your fork on GitHub.

## Development Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and consistent development process, please follow these guidelines:

- **Follow the coding standards** used in the project.
- **Write tests** for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- **Keep your commits small and focused** on one task or issue.
- **Document your code** where necessary.
- **Ensure your changes pass all tests** before submitting a pull request.
Here's the updated "Development Guidelines" section with the instruction to create a fork and branch:


To contribute code to **Eve**, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the **Eve** repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eve.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your work isolated:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```
   Replace `your-feature-branch` with a descriptive name for your branch, such as `add-new-feature` or `fix-bug`.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

5. **Write Tests**: Ensure that you write tests for any new functionality or bug fixes. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase.

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Once your changes are ready, commit them to your branch with a clear and descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature XYZ to improve event creation process"
   ```

7. **Push Your Branch**: Push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your branch is pushed, open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original **Eve** repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you made and reference any related issues.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure a smooth and efficient development process for everyone involved.
## Pull Request Process

When you are ready to submit your changes:

1. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch of the repository.
2. **Describe your changes** in the pull request, referencing any related issues.
3. **Wait for a review**. The project maintainers will review your code and may request changes.
4. **Make any requested changes** and update the pull request.
5. **Once approved**, your pull request will be merged into the `main` branch.

## Contact

If you have any questions or need further assistance:

- **Open an issue** on GitHub.
- **Reach out to the maintainers** via email at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com).
